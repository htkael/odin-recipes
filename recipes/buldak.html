        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Buldak, which translates to "fire chicken" in Korean, is a beloved dish known for its intense spice and bold flavors. This Korean classic features tender, bite-sized pieces of chicken marinated and cooked in a fiery gochujang (Korean chili paste) sauce. The marinade typically includes soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and sugar, balancing heat with sweetness for a mouthwatering taste.

                Traditionally, buldak is grilled over an open flame to achieve a smoky char, but it can also be pan-fried or baked for convenience. Itâ€™s often topped with a generous layer of melted mozzarella cheese, which adds a creamy contrast to the spiciness.
                
                Served alongside rice cakes, steamed rice, or a cold beer, buldak is a favorite among spice enthusiasts. Whether enjoyed as a main dish or a shared appetizer, this fiery delicacy promises a flavor-packed experience that keeps diners coming back for more.
                
                Perfect for anyone who loves bold and adventurous flavors!
